  </summary>

  - Create project
  - Copy contents of main.py 
  - Create a folder `hw11`
  - Inside hw11 copy contents of validations.py
  - Inside hw11 create new file db_functions.py
  - Copy employee_operations() function from from previous assignments class_functions.py (from employees folder)
  - Inside hw11, ceate new file `employees.db`
</details>

## In db_functions.py

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Modify employee_operations()
  </summary>

  - Remove the function call to file_to_dictionary() 
  - Open connection to database named employees.db (import the required package)  
    ‚è© Refer to Tutorial 14-5 a,b
  - Get the cursor for the connection ‚è© Refer to Tutorial 14-5c
  - Comment out the rest of the code (we will uncomment as we need it)
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Create table <code>employees</code>
  </summary>

  - In employee_operations function, after getting the cursor
  - Write statement to create table named `employees` only if it doesn't exist (‚è© Refer to 14-6e)
  - Columns are as follows
    - empid - integer and primary key
    - name - text
    - department - text
    - salary - real number
    - email - text
  - Commit the changes (‚è© Refer to 14-5e)
</details>


## In main.py

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Call employee_operations
  </summary>

  - Import the db_functions module
  - Call employee operations inside main body

</summary>

  - It accepts two parameters, connection and cursor
  - It doesn't return anything

    - Create a tuple of the above values (‚è© Refer to Tutorial 7-27c)
    - Write a parametrized statement to insert these values into the table `employees` (‚è© Refer to 14-7e)
    - Using the cursor, execute this by passing this statement and tuple as parameters      
    üí° We don't need to generate next ID and insert it because the database does it for you  
    - Commit the changes (‚è© Refer to 14-5e)  
    üö© Make sure the number of elements in the tuple match the number of `?`

</details>
